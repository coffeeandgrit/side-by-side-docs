[Stripe](www.stripe.com/api/docs) has beautiful, developer-friendly documentation where functional descriptions are next to examples.  I wanted to be able to make similar documentation, but alas, no such tooling existed.

Then I saw [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28733235/stripe-api-documentation) on StackOverflow and my heart sank.  Stripe has no plans of library-ifying their documentation tooling.

Still wanting Stripe-style documentation, this small side project was started as a starting place.
